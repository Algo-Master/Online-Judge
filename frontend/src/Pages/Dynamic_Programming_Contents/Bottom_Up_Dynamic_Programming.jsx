        Until now you've only seen top-down dynamic programming with
        memoization. However, we can also solve problems with bottom-up dynamic
        programming. Bottom up is exactly the opposite of top-down, you start at
        the bottom (base cases of the recursion), and extend it to more and more
        values.
